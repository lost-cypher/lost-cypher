- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, robots, AI, neural networks,  disassembling things and creating the best bread in the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning Python to get a Portfolio startet
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting and new as long as my days have some time left over ^^
- 📫 How to reach me: I'll hook up linkedIn/xing/gmail after i got some things to show in my repo (estimated around Octobre 2021). Until then - Happy Coding : )

Right now I am working at a logistics-firm as technical Support for their CRM. <br>
I troubleshoot certain errors for users and create custom sql-reports(Oracle) for our different departments or my bosses.  <br>
Other than that i automate my workload using VBA to get more time to code rather than doing menial copy-paste-send. <br> <br>
My first programming language was qbasic when i was 11. Afterwards i dabbled in delphi, c++, python, java, as well as PHP, HTML, CSS and JS.  <br>
Most of those things i would have to relearn due to not using it for too long but the basic concepts stick^^ <br> <br>
Right now i am relearning python.  <br>
My last project in python was around 4 years ago and involved a webscraper that showed updates to my favourite Mangas on a half-transparent sidebar using tkinter. <br>

My plan is to build a proper portfolio with python-projects here on github and get hired^^  <br>
My current employer unfortunately told me clearly they do not have the budget to raise my salary to the same lvl as my 2 coworkers, <br>
while i am still expected to do the same work for the same number of hours, with the same amount of experience^^ (I get about half) <br>
So that was my pity-party :) now let me get back to work on my portfolio so you can be impressed with my skills sometime in the near future <br>\\(°o°)/  <br>
 <br>
Regards,  <br>
 <br>
Sebastian
